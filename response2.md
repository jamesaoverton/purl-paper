# Response to Reviewers

We would once again like to thank the reviewers for their helpful comments.

Reviewer 2 has clarified that he was asked to evaluate "does it provide sound evidence of its (potential for) reuse?" and that we have not provided sufficient evidence. This was a misunderstanding on our part of the review criteria, which we believe have been revised to include more information about the new "resource paper" category since we originally submitted our manuscript. In any case, with our misunderstanding resolved, we are happy to address this review criterion.

We have updated our GitHub repository to make it clear that our code is distributed under a BSD3 open source license.

We have added a paragraph to the "Future Work" section explaining that our code is free for other communities to reuse under an open source license, and that by adapting our YAML configuration format to suit their own needs they run their own PURL server to can gain the same benefits that we have over the w3id.org system.

We have also made the two typos which were pointed out to us.
